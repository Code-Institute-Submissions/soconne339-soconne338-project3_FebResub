## Intro

This Story-Vault is a command-line based application which allows the user to choose from a selection of stories using the input keyboard. The app was created so the user can use a variety of different nouns and verbs to create a story. The story is extremely user friendly and is aimed at adults and children who are able to read (6 years +)

## UX

The program was created with simplicity in mind. the only thing the user has to do is input their name, numbers 1-4 and yes/no. This means that it 's user friendly to anyone who can read and type English. 

## Ideal Client

The ideal client for this program is: 
1. Someone who is English speaking with full literacy skills
2. Someone who likes to read 
3. Someone who enjoys an interactive experience
4. Someone young

## User Stories

1. 38F - I found the program quite interesting and I liked the selection of stories available. 
2. 9M - I would love to have an option to create a game by choosing the words. The jokes were funny
3. 60F - I loved using the program and it left a smile on my face. Nice and easy to use and the jokes were hillarious

## Skeleton

The program was outputted as a terminal therefore it's a single page application. Python was used to generate the data and stories. I have included a flow-chart to illustrate the program's process.
