## Intro

This Story-Vault is a command-line based application which allows the user to choose from a selection of stories using the input keyboard. The app was created so the user can use a variety of different nouns and verbs to create a story. The story is extremely user friendly and is aimed at adults and children who are able to read (6 years +)

## UX

The program was created with simplicity in mind. the only thing the user has to do is input their name, numbers 1-4 and yes/no. This means that it 's user friendly to anyone who can read and type English.
